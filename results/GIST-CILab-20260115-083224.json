            "completeness_reason": "There is a complete absence of strategic decision-making. The path is singular and linear, with no obstacles, enemies, or items to influence player choice. The gameplay is reduced to simple, mandatory jumps.",
            "aesthetics": 1,
            "aesthetics_reason": "The map is visually barren and unappealing. The sparse placement of generic blocks against a plain blue background creates an empty, unfinished, and aesthetically poor look.",
